# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

Do not clean your ears with bobby pins, twisted napkin corners, or other long pointed objects.
Do not use cotton swabs. They will merely push the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage.
Do not use ear candles.')
