	<h2>Why is it important to Donate?</h2>
	<p>
		Donating not only gives you a sense of purpose in helping someone but it also helps us continue to fulfil our mission of helping people in need.

	<p>
		Humble Hearts is not government funded. We run solely on donations. We depend on your time, monetary funding, sponsorship, and items in order to function. Every single cent of your donations goes toward our purpose.
