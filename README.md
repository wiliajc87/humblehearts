| This is a website created for Humble Hearts, a Chicago area 	 |
| non-profit dedicated to helping the less fortunate. It was     | 
| created over 24 continuous hours by a team of 10 web           |
| professionals for The Nerdery's Overnight Website Challenge    | 
| in 2015. It was created using Ruby on Rails with a custom      |
| content management system designed to allow for the owner to   |   |dynamically update the content of the pages without support.    |
