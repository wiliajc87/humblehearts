This is a website created for Humble Hearts, a Chicago area non-profit dedicated to helping the less fortunate. It was created over 24 continuous hours by a team of 10 web professionals for The Nerdery's Overnight Website Challenge in 2015. It was created using Ruby on Rails with a custom content management system designed to allow for the owner to dynamically update the content of the pages without support.
